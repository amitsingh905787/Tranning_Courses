Linux I/O Redirection & Data Streams – Summary

Commands take data in (input) and send data out (output).

Linux has three standard data streams:

Standard Input (stdin) → 0

Standard Output (stdout) → 1

Standard Error (stderr) → 2

Data streams can be redirected from their default screen location to files or other commands.

> → overwrite a file with output.

>> → append output to a file.

2> → redirect errors to a file.

You can pipe (|) output of one command into the input of another.

Be careful: redirection may truncate files if > is used without caution.
