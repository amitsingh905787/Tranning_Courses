Find Command (Advanced)

Search files by name (-name, -iname) and size (-size with +, -, ranges).

Limit search depth with -maxdepth.

Use -exec to run commands on results (copy/move/delete).

Created a haystack test environment and used find & locate to find needle.txt.

Key Takeaway: find is extremely powerful for custom searches and automation.

Viewing Files

cat → View/join multiple files.

tac → Reverse file vertically.

rev → Reverse content horizontally.

head, tail, less → View specific sections or scroll through large files.

Sorting Data

sort for alphabetic, numeric, reverse (-r), and unique (-u) sorting.

Column-based sorting with sort -k (file size, months, link counts, etc.).

Used -h for human-readable sizes and -M for months.

Archiving & Compression

tar → Create/extract archives.

gzip → Faster, less compression.

bzip2 → Slower, stronger compression.

zip/unzip → Standard cross-platform compression.

Project Tasks

Secret Directory: Created hidden content, indexed with locate.

Large File Analysis: Found and sorted files over 1MB using find + ls + sort.

Automation & Scheduling

Wrote shell scripts for directory creation, file backup, and logging.

Scheduled recurring tasks with cron (hungry script writing logs every minute).

Daily Learning Outcomes

Mastered find for advanced search.

Practiced file viewing & manipulation (cat, tac, rev, head, tail, less).

Learned sorting techniques (sort, sort -k).

Practiced archiving/compression (tar, gzip, bzip2, zip).

Automated tasks with shell scripts and cron jobs.

Difficulty: Advanced
Next Focus: Text processing & regular expressions
